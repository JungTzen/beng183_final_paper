### scRNA-sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics<a name="231"></a>
* **scRNA**:
  * **Background**:
    Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recent development in genomic analysis introduced by Tang et al. in 2009. Single cell RNA sequecing allows scientists to analyze the genomes/transcriptomes of individual cells at a high-resolution which opens doors in understanding more about cellular function and heterogeneity, cell population and subpopulation identification, etc. Being a highly sensitive ultra-low-input method, scRNA-seq is able to capture more information when other methods would consider it as "noise." Tools that are most commonly used for scRNA-seq analysis would be Scanpy (Python) and Seurat (R) both offer similar functions in preprocessing, clustering, quality control, visualization, identification of cell types, and many more.

  * **Tools**:

* **Imaging Spatial Transcriptomics**: 
  * **Background**:
    Spatial transcriptomics is a molecular profiling method used to help scientists measure gene activity in tissue and map where the activity occurs at. The tool we will be focusing on will be MERFISH (Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) which is a very popular tool for handling spatial transcriptomics. MERFISH (Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) is a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptome profiling technology that enables the visualization and counting of a large number of RNA transcripts from hundreds to tens of thousands of genes across tissue slices with single-cell resolution. 
  * **Method**:

     MERFISH is based on single-molecule FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), where fluorescently labeled probes bind to the desired RNA targets with high specificity, allowing the direct counting of the number of fluorescent spots under a high-resolution microscope to quantify RNA expression. Combinatorial labeling, sequential imaging, and error-robust barcoding are added to single-molecule FISH by MERFISH, which significantly boosts multiplexing capacity and makes spatially resolved, single-cell gene expression profiling possible.

Furthermore, the barcoding system is built with error resilience to guarantee precise and reliable outcomes.[Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/O0QekKSscjA)
  * **Tools**:
    MERFISH data generated on the MERSCOPE is compatible with third-party software such as Scanpy/Squidpy, Seurat, Voyager, and Giotto, which are already integrated into many existing single-cell analysis workstreams. Plotting packages such as matplotlib can also be used to plot the spatial data.

### Similarities and Differences<a name="3"></a>
* **Similarities**
  * **Gene expression analysis**:Both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and MERFISH are used for gene expression analysis at the single-cell level, providing insights into the transcriptional profiles of individual cells

  * **Single-cell resolution**: Both technologies offer single-cell resolution, allowing the study of gene expression at the individual cell level, which is essential for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function within complex tissues

* **Differences**
  * **Methodologies**
    * scRNA-seq: Involves isolating RNA from single cells, converting it to cDNA, sequencing 
    * MERFISH: Uses spatially barcoded oligos/probes to capture spatial information by imaging tissue sections or samples 
  * **MERFISH has additional Spatial Data**: Unlike scRNA-seq, MERFISH provides spatially resolved gene expression data, allowing the visualization and counting of RNA transcripts with spatial information, which is crucial for understanding the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues
  * **Use cases**: scRNA-seq and MERFISH have different use cases and are often chosen based on the specific research questions and the need for spatial information in gene expression analysis
  * **Gene Dropout Rates**: MERFISH has been shown to have improvements in overall gene dropout rates and sensitivity compared to scRNA-seq, which is an important consideration when choosing the appropriate technology for specific research applications


### Real World Uses
By integrating scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, researchers can gain a more holistic understanding of biological systems, combining the depth of single-cell analysis with the critical context of spatial distribution.

**Advanced Cancer Research:**

Spatial Transcriptomics has been incredibly helpful in understanding the spatial heterogeneity of tumors. It has helped us characterize tertiary lymphoid structures, also known as TLSs which are formations at sites with persistent inflamatory stimiluation (like tumors). By using ST scientists have able to understand the spatial organization of immune cells and thier role in anti-tumor responses. On the flip side of the coin, RNA-seq helps us understand the gene expression profiles of cancel cells which further helps us in our understanding of molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression. 

**Developmental biology:**

Development biology spans many different specific subfields of biology (both from an anatomical view or a disease-centric view). Spatial transcriptomics serves as a valuable tool in furthering our understanding of this field as  it provides a visual/spatial view of how tissues and cells change over the course of development. ST helps in understanding how different cells contribute to the growth and formation of comlplex biological structures. This is an incredible tool which enhances the prelimainary genetic compository information that RNA-seq provides. 

**Drug Development and Response Monitoring:**

Regarding drug development and responnse monitoring, spatial transcriptomics has played a vital role in understand the spatial heterogenity of dru responses at the cellular level. An example of ths is the graph-based domain adoption model called SpaRx. This model uses pharmacogenomics profiles to interpret single-cell spatial transcriptomics data. Ultimately, the model allows scientists to identify spatially localized cellular resistance and hence optimize treatment for individual patients. SpaRx has demonstrated high accuracy in characterizing spatial therapeutic variability, uncovering the molecular mechanisms underpinning drug resistance, and identifying personalized drug targets and effective drug combinationsâ€‹. RNA sequencing also plays a crucial role in identifiyign drug targets and understnad the molecular mechanisms behind the interactions of drugs.

**Immunological Research:**

Spatial transcriptomics helps us map the spatial distribution of immune cells in tissues and understand thier interactions relating to immune responses. Interestingly, many of ST's contributions to immunological research can be connected to cancer biology. An example of this is how ST was used to understand melanoma in a zebrafish model. The researchers focused on BRAF V600E-driven melanomas, utilizing ST to capture the complex spatial patterns within the tumor and its interaction with various surrounding tissues. The study highlighted the transcriptional distinctiveness of the tumor-microenvironment interface, a crucial area for understanding tumor invasion and growth.
