# scRNA-sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recent development in genomic analysis. It focuses on the transcriptomes of individual cells. It allows scientists to get a glimpse into the similarities and differences within a population of cells. Popular tools for scRNA-seq analysis are scanpy and Seurat

Spatial transcriptomics is a molecular profiling method used to help scientists measure gene activity in tissue and map where the activity occurs at. The tool we will be focusing on will be MERFISH (Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) which is a very popular tool for handling spatial transcriptomics.

# Pros and Cons
## scRNA-seq
Pros: Widely-Used Versatility Efficiency (More genes per sequence)
Cons: Lack of Spatial Information Data Integration challenges Gene dropout due to technical limitations Lower resolution

## Spatial Transcriptomics
Pros: Spatial Resolution Higher resolution Improved sensitivity
Cons: Specialized equipment Library Prep Complexity Cost Limited amount of genes

# Similarities and Differences
## Similarities
Both expression analysis Both have single-cell resolution Both offer quantitative gene expression measurement

## Differences
Methodologies 
scRNA-seq: Involves isolating RNA from single cells, converting it to cDNA, sequencing 
ST: Uses spatially barcoded oligos/probes to capture spatial information by imaging tissue sections or samples 
Additional Spatial Data 
Use cases 
Gene Dropout Rates

# Real World Uses
By integrating scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, researchers can gain a more holistic understanding of biological systems, combining the depth of single-cell analysis with the critical context of spatial distribution.
